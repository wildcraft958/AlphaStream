AlphaStream Live AI Agent - DataQuest 2026
Overview
Building a real-time streaming RAG system for financial trading recommendations using Pathway framework. Deadline: January 18, 2026, 11:59 PM IST.

Stage 1: Foundation & MVP (Must Ship First)
Core infrastructure and minimal working demo

 Project structure setup
 Create modular folder structure (src/, tests/, data/, docs/)
 Set up 
pyproject.toml
 with dependencies (Pathway, FastAPI, etc.)
 Create 
.env.example
 and config management
 Pathway streaming connector
 Custom Python connector for NewsAPI.org polling
 Basic streaming mode with 30s refresh interval
 Article deduplication logic
 Basic RAG pipeline
 Simple chunking (sentence-based)
 Embedding generation (sentence-transformers, local)
 In-memory vector index with cosine similarity
 MVP API endpoint
 FastAPI /recommend POST endpoint
 Basic sentiment extraction with LLM
 Health check endpoint
Initial tests
 Unit tests for connector
 Unit tests for RAG retrieval
 Manual test: query returns recommendation
 Frontend Dashboard
 React + Vite + Shadcn setup
 Bloomberg terminal dark theme
 Dashboard components (Ticker, News, Chart placeholders)
 Integrate API with frontend
Stage 2: Enhanced RAG & Multi-Agent System
Improve accuracy and add reasoning capabilities

 Adaptive chunking
 Semantic boundary detection
 Ticker extraction from articles
 Metadata enrichment (source, date, tickers)
 Hybrid retrieval
 Dense retrieval (embeddings)
 Sparse retrieval (BM25)
 Combined scoring (0.7 dense + 0.3 sparse)
 Reranking layer
 Cross-encoder reranking
 Top-k final selection
 Multi-Agent reasoning system
 Sentiment Analysis Agent
 Technical Analysis Agent
 Risk Assessment Agent
 Trading Decision Agent (orchestrator)
 Agent tests
 Mock LLM responses for deterministic tests
 Integration test: full pipeline flow
Stage 3: Real-Time Features & Demo Polish
Proof of dynamism for judges

 WebSocket streaming
 /ws/stream/{ticker} endpoint
 Real-time sentiment updates push
 Latency tracking
 Measure time from article arrival to index
 Track end-to-end query latency
 Display metrics in response
 Demo dashboard (optional)
 Simple HTML/JS visualization
 Real-time sentiment heatmap
 Explainability
 Track which articles influenced decision
 Reasoning trace generation
 Dynamism proof
 Script to inject new article
 Show recommendation change in <2s
Stage 4: Documentation & Submission
Final deliverables

 README.md
 Architecture overview
 Setup instructions
 API documentation
 ARCHITECTURE.md
 Component diagrams
 Data flow explanation
 Docker deployment
 Dockerfile
 docker-compose.yml
 Video demonstration
 3-minute demo recording
 Show real-time dynamism
 Final cleanup
 Remove debug code
 Ensure all tests pass
 Push to GitHub
Testing Strategy
Unit tests: pytest for individual components
Integration tests: Full pipeline flow with mock data
Manual demo test: Inject article → verify recommendation change
