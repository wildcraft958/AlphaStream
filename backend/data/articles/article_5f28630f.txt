Early 2026 data suggests a significant rotation in the US stock market, with small-cap companies and non-tech sectors outperforming. This shift reverses 2025's trend, where large-cap tech dominated, largely due to the AI investment boom. Analysts attribute the current rotation to closing earnings gaps, lower interest rates benefiting small caps, recent geopolitical events, and a stronger-than-expected US economy.
