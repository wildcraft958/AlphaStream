Alphabet (GOOG) shares slipped after Google requested a halt to certain search antitrust measures while it appeals a ruling. The company is trying to avoid sharing search data with competitors, despite regulators considering tougher measures like a potential Chrome divestiture. Investors are watching key dates including PCE inflation data on January 22, and Alphabet's earnings call on February 4.
