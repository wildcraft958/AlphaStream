Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) recently crossed the $4 trillion market cap level but subsequently experienced a pullback, mirroring similar behavior seen with other megacap stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) after reaching significant market cap milestones. While short-term volatility is common after such peaks, historical data suggests that stocks closing above trillion-dollar thresholds generally show positive long-term returns, with many outperforming the S&P 500 Index over a year. This pattern indicates that despite immediate "hangovers," long-term buy-and-hold strategies for those bullish on Big Tech may still be viable.
