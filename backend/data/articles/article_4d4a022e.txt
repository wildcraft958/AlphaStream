    BREAKING: AAPL is facing a significant regulatory investigation that could result 
    in billions of dollars in fines. Sources close to the matter indicate that the 
    investigation has been ongoing for months and could lead to serious consequences 
    for the company's operations.
    
    Analysts are downgrading the stock in response to this news, with several major 
    firms issuing sell recommendations. The company's market capitalization has already 
    dropped significantly in pre-market trading as investors react to the uncertainty.
    
    Key concerns include potential antitrust violations, data privacy issues, and 
    possible fraud allegations. Legal experts suggest the case could take years to 
    resolve and may result in leadership changes.
