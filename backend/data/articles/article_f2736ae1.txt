FEDERATED HERMES, INC. reduced its stake in Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc by 29.62%, selling 1,390,420 shares at $6.13 each. While Arcturus appears undervalued with a GF Value of $11.28, its low profitability, financial distress indicated by an Altman Z score of 0.28, and a Piotroski F-Score of 2 warrant a cautious outlook for investors. This strategic move by Federated Hermes suggests a reevaluation of the biotechnology company's future prospects despite a significant post-transaction gain in ARCT's stock price.
