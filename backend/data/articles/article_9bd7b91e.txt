OpenAI has started offering its new chatbot ads to dozens of advertisers, The ​Information reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with ‌the matter.  OpenAI is asking that to a small pool of advertisers ‌for less than $1 million in spending commitments each over a several week trial period, with ads launching in early February, the report said.  The company does not yet offer ​technology that lets advertisers easily buy ads themselves, ‌but is working to get self-service ads up and running, The Information report said.
