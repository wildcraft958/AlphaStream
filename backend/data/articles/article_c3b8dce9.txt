Cortland Associates Inc. MO reduced its stake in Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) by 14.0% in the third quarter, making it their 9th largest holding. Despite this, Alphabet's stock achieved a $4 trillion market cap due to strong AI momentum, including Apple's adoption of Google's Gemini for Siri, and outperformed earnings estimates. However, insider selling, legal challenges regarding AI training data, and operational constraints like data center hookups present potential future headwinds for the company.
