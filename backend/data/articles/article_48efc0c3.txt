STORY: Streaming services captured nearly half of all U.S. television viewership in December, powered by Christmas Day NFL games on Netflix and its highly anticipated final season of "Stranger Things."That's according to a report Tuesday by audience measurement firm Nielsen.In its monthly report, The Gauge, Nielsen said streaming cemented its dominance over broadcast and cable with a record 47.5% of total TV viewing in the U.S.On Christmas Day alone, streaming commanded 54% of all TV viewership, the largest single-day share ever recorded by the industry.Google's YouTube accounted for more than 12.5% of all TV viewing last month, representing the largest audience share for a streaming service.Netflix viewership was up 10% from November, with "Stranger Things" December's most-watched streaming title.Nielsen said broadcast accounted for roughly 21% of TV viewership in December, while cable had a 20% share.The data reflects the ongoing transformation of the television industry, as viewers increasingly gravitate toward on-demand content and live sports migrate to digital platforms.The shift is driving consolidation in the sector, with Netflix bidding nearly $83 billion to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming assets.
